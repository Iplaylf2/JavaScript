环境模型这词来自于《SICP》这本书。

> The environment is crucial to the evaluation process, because it determines the context in which an
expression should be evaluated.
Indeed, one could say that expressions in a programming language do not,in themselves, have any meaning. Rather, an expression acquires a meaning only with respect to some environment in which it is evaluated. Even the interpretation of an expression as straightforward as (+ 1 1) depends on an understanding that one is operating in a context in which + is the symbol for addition.

> 环境对求值过程起着决定作用，因为它决定了表达式求值的上下文。
实际上，我们可以认为表达式本身在一个程序语言里没有任何意义。一个表达式的意义取决于他求值时所在的环境。甚至像(+ 1 1)这一个极其简单的表达式的解释过程，都要在一个符号+表示加法的上下文里执行。
